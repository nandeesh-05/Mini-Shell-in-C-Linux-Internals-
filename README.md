# Mini-Shell-in-C-Linux-Internals-
Developed a Mini Shell in C that simulates core functionality of a Linux shell. The project demonstrates Linux system programming concepts such as process creation, command execution, signal handling, and inter-process communication, providing hands-on understanding of how shells work internally.
